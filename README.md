Are you a developer looking to promote your work? In this course, Leigh Lawhon
shows you how to build and showcase your work by building a portfolio site with GitHub Pages. Join Leigh to learn some design basics and how to utilize Codespaces to set up projects in minutes. She shows you how to use the site generator Jekyll, provides helpful coding samples, and an overview of what employers are looking for. Plus, learn how to support your work with visual and writing skills that complement your coding skills. If you want to show off the work you’ve done in a professional and easy to navigate site, join Leigh in this course.

_See the readme file in the main branch for updated instructions and information._
## Instructions
This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage, or you can add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to access.

## Branches
The branches are structured to correspond to the videos in the course. The naming convention is `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#`. As an example, the branch named `02_03` corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter. 
Some branches will have a beginning and an end state. These are marked with the letters `b` for "beginning" and `e` for "end". The `b` branch contains the code as it is at the beginning of the movie. The `e` branch contains the code as it is at the end of the movie. The `main` branch holds the final state of the code when in the course.

When switching from one exercise files branch to the next after making changes to the files, you may get a message like this:

    error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by checkout:        [files]
    Please commit your changes or stash them before you switch branches.
    Aborting

To resolve this issue:
	
    Add changes to git using this command: git add .
	Commit changes using this command: git commit -m "some message"

## Installing
1. To use these exercise files, you must have the following installed:
	- All packages will be installed during the course.
2. Clone this repository into your local machine using the terminal (Mac), CMD (Windows), or a GUI tool like SourceTree.
