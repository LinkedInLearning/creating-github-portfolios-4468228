## Background
In 2019 I was awarded a Department of Education SBIR grant to build an educational board game about collaboration. Though the game would eventually be a series, focusing on different STEM vocations, the first prototype focused on collaboration in tech.

Research shows that the top skill missing from new employees (especially those just out of school) is collaboration. Often students spend their academic career focusing on their own success and grades. When they enter their career, they struggle with shifting to an environment where team success is valued. The aim of the game is to teach students to collaborate and why itâ€™s important.

## Approach
My team and I performed research on and tested multiple prototypes with a local school over an 2 month period. Each session we observed game play and collected qualitative and quantitative data and then iterated on the prototype. One observation was that the tokens were very difficult to put away and therefore not suitable for a classroom setting where time can be limited.

Additionally, curriculum was developed to accompany the game.

## Results
At the conclusion on the grant, it was decided not to pursue publishing of the game. I felt there was something missing. The mechanics worked well, and students collaborated, but it lacked and element of excitement and was too didactic.

## Next Steps
 In 2023, I reworked the theme of the game. I simplified the game by combining some of the cards and reduced the number of piece by getting rid of the tokens. Additionally, I decided the base game should be general business.

 We are invited to the Ed Games Expo, September 19-22, 2023.
