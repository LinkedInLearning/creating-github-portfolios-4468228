## Hi there, I’m Leigh Stewardson!
I started my career as a designer. I was very good at the details of the software programs I was using and began to teach. Through the years, I became curious about how software was created and why some products were hard to use while others were intuitive. This led me to my second career in UI design and frontend development. I taught myself HTML, CSS and JavaScript and soon began designing and building my own user-centric, React and Node applications.

I’m passionate about building beautiful and user-centric products for the web. I am a lifelong learner who loves to teach, which has led to my role as a Product Manager in the EdTech space.

I currently looking for work that utilizes my expertise and industry knowledge and allows me to grow as a Product Manager and strategist.
